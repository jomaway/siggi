## About the project

The main purpose of this project is to get started with rust programming.
So i am thankfull for every advice and suggestion for improvement.

Another motivation was to generate nice timing diagrams for education and presentation purpose.
I took some inspiration from [wavedrom](https://wavedrom.com/).
